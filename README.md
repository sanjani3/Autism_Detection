The Autism Detection model utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like MobileNetV2 and VGG19, to analyze images of children and determine whether they exhibit signs of autism. By extracting facial features through various layers within these models, the system can differentiate between autistic and non-autistic individuals based on visual cues.
Early detection of autism is crucial as it enables children to receive specialized care and support from a young age. While there is no definitive cure for autism, early intervention can significantly improve social interaction skills and overall quality of life. By leveraging advanced technology like the Autism Detection model, we can enhance the prospects of early diagnosis and intervention, ultimately empowering children with autism to better connect with others and thrive socially.
